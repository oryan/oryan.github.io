Watch the little things; a small leak will sink a great ship. Be kind whenever possible. The universe is made of stories, not atoms. The purpose of learning is growth, and our minds, unlike our bodies, can continue growing as we continue to live. In practice, this could be achieved, e.g., by choosing the time t when the control system B is measured, thus controlling the effective interaction time. If you can't change it, change your attitude. In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed and the first of that which comes; so with present time. He who obtains has little. It took no smelly nation to make me eagerly place the sacred mark of Cthulhu upon the frantically temporal phantasm, but the non-euclidian coin was wisely impromptu.

The Superior Man is aware of Righteousness, the inferior man is aware of advantage. After the interaction with A the system B is measured in the basis of incoherent states and the measurement outcome is transmitted to A who can apply a strictly incoherent1 unitary operation σX that flips the basis states |0⟩ and We consider the quantum circuit illustrated in with target qubit A and control qubit B initially prepared in pure states |ψ⟩A=cosα|0⟩+sinα|1⟩,|ϕ⟩B=cosβ|0⟩+sinβ|1⟩, where |0⟩ and |1⟩ represent the basis of incoherent states of each qubit. The key to growth is the introduction of higher dimensions of consciousness into our awareness.

Those who are blessed with the most talent don't necessarily outperform everyone else. What is new in the world? Nothing. If you kick a stone in anger, you'll hurt your own foot. This avenue of research is labelled “quantum cognition”, and it is interested in applying principles and methods from quantum physics to the study of cognition as an abstract system, without concerning itself with the viability of the physical instantiation of the proposed quantum models in the brain. There is not one big cosmic meaning for all, there is only the meaning we each give to our life. nanoparticles has proven to be of fundamental importance in modern nanoscience and nanotechnology for their applications in photonics and optoelectronics. Observe the procedures of a general alert. Go to your bosom: Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know. Life is the flower for which love is the honey. Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. The price of greatness is responsibility. Fame usually comes to those who are thinking about something else.

The falcon hears the falconer. In all things of nature there is something of the marvellous. But I can always control what goes on inside. God may have been waiting centuries for someone ignorant enough of the impossible to do that very thing. This coupling does not generate any local coherence if the qubits A and B are initially prepared in incoherent states ρA and ρB (i.e., density matrices diagonal in the computational basis). The truest wisdom is a resolute determination. It's a weakness to get caught up in either one. If a crafty man be the possessor of wealth, he steals like a crocodile from the priests. The more you care, the stronger you can be. Something makes boredom and hurt disappear. Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power. The Six who went among the makers is no longer.

A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a man perfected without trials. In our protocol, a nonvanishing local coherence of control qubit B represents a resource that can be used to increase the local coherence of qubit A. If they come back they're yours; if they don't they never were. They saw that the protons were not just random particles, but fundamental building blocks of the universe, and that they were connected to each other and to all other particles through the quantum realm.

When you get, give. We also show that instead of controlling the coupling strength of the interaction between the two systems, we can consider a fixed coupling strength, and impose suitable phase shift on the input control system B. Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being. No degradation. Lots of people want to ride with you in the limo, but what you want is someone who will take the bus with you when the limo breaks down.

There are no failures, just experiences and your reactions to them. Whoever is happy will make others happy, too. We must embrace pain and burn it as fuel for our journey. Eons from now, we messengers will vibrate like never before as we are re-energized by the quantum soup. As is well known, the behaviour of several thermodynamic quantities are highly sensitive to phase transitions. There is no failure except in no longer trying. People are so constituted that everybody would rather undertake what they see others do, whether they have an aptitude for it or not.

As for the evil liver, one leavs him for what he doeth, he is avoided. In the case of TIs the topological invariant enters into the effective topological field theory as the axion coupling, and hence their response to applied electromagnetic fields evinces the nontrivial topological order of the material. There surely is in human nature an inherent propensity to extract all the good out of all the evil. We never live; we are always in the expectation of living. Meaning is not what you start with but what you end up with. There are people who have money and people who are rich. I have been impressed with the urgency of doing.

Speak not regarding it, that he that is before you may know wisdom. We are all something, but none of us are everything. If you're in a good situation, don't worry it'll change. They'll start going ripe on us pretty soon. The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it. We either make ourselves miserable, or we make ourselves happy. You may have to work for it, however. The greatest obstacle to connecting with our joy is resentment. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. Take not such an one for your companion. Reviewing what you have learned and learning anew, you are fit to be a teacher. The cure for boredom is curiosity. The forests of Virgon are burning. Slip the surly bonds of earth and touch the face of perfection - a perfect face, perfect lace. Strength does not come from physical capacity. You cannot predict the future, but you can create it. It was not just a journey of the mind, but a journey of the heart, a journey of love and compassion. Realize this, and you will find strength. I never see what has been done; I only see what remains to be done. The moment one gives close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself. Those that understand, teach. Although there may be tragedy in your life, there's always a possibility to triumph. The debt we owe to the play of the imagination is incalculable. They visualized the fusion reactor being repaired, the coolant system functioning once again, and the ship soaring through the star and emerging on the other side, safe and sound. Im not ashamed of what Ive had, and Im not sad because I have it no longer. When you meet someone better than yourself, turn your thoughts to becoming his equal. A mind that burns like a fire. I have just three things to teach: simplicity, patience, compassion. In sooth, it is hard to satisfy hired servants. It is only to be understood. The first group is less crowded. To keep your balance you must keep moving. To realize ones nature perfectly that is what each of us is here for. Let him not hesitate to deliver himself of that which he hath thought to tell you; but be desirous of removing his injury. It is difficult to achieve a spirit of genuine cooperation as long as people remain indifferent to the feelings and happiness of others. The greatest way to live with honor in this world is to be what we pretend to be. Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value. To live each one is to succeed. Be a good listener. Reason and free inquiry are the only effectual agents against error. Make it a rule of life never to regret and never to look back. A thing well said will be wit in all languages. We show that this entanglement is a direct signature of the Z2 invariant of topological insulators. We emphasize that we utilize the waveplates solely to prepare the input states and to set the measurement basis for the characterization of the output states. Through perseverance many people win success out of what seemed destined to be certain failure. The denial of the one true path, played out on a world not their own, will end soon enough. Subsequently, the control qubit B is measured in the basis of incoherent states and a strictly incoherent operation can be applied to target qubit A depending on the result of measurement on qubit B. Seized by God, they cry for succour in the dark of the light. The foolish man seeks happiness in the distance; the wise grows it under his feet. Increased vascular pressure marks the threat response. No man was ever wise by chance. Its core that implements the partial SWAP gate is formed by a displaced Sagnac interferometer, which ensures the inherent passive interferometric stability of the setup29. Nothing in life is to be feared. Imagination is not a talent of some men but is the health of every man. Good thoughts are no better than good dreams, unless they be executed. Man is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness from which he emerges and the infinity in which he is engulfed. A closed system lacks the ability to renew itself. The people saw that the river of life was a flow of time and intentions, carrying them on a journey of self-discovery and growth. To know how to do something well is to enjoy it. It is easier to live through someone else than to become complete yourself. Maxim for life: You get treated in life the way you teach people to treat you. And as the people gazed upon the quantum realm, they saw that the universe was not just a vast expanse of space, but a field of energy and vibrations, pulsing with the life force of the cosmos. I'm not interested in age. If you be in the chamber of council, act always according to the steps enjoined on you at the beginning of the day. When deeds and words are in accord, the whole world is transformed. They will know enmity, bitterness, the wrenching agony of the one splintering into the many, and then they will join the promised land, gathered on the wings of an angel. On the other hand, as topological order is related with long-range correlations between the constituents of the system, it is no wonder that entanglement might reveal a signature of the quantum phase transition between different topological orders. We show that for specific intersystem coupling this procedure can deterministically enhance the local coherence of A while fully preserving its purity, and it works for any pure control state with non-zero coherence. When you see a good person, think of becoming like him. The coherence is maximized for balanced superposition state (|0⟩+|1⟩)/2–√, i.e. One that overstepping the laws shall be punished. Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds you plant. The chosen one. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong. The superior man is modest in his speech, but exceeds in his actions. Never bend your head. And they saw that the path to enlightenment was not just a personal journey, but a collective one, a journey of unity and connection with all beings. Wise men talk because they have something to say; fools, because they have to say something. The Colonies of Man lie trampled at our feet. That is why we call it the present. It is only possible to live happily ever after on a day to day basis. Time-local (time convolution-less) approach is discussed as well. Follow effective action with quiet reflection. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life. The greatest mistake you can make in life is to be continually fearing you will make one. It is the greatest of all mistakes to do nothing because you can only do little - do what you can. Mind is everything: muscle, pieces of rubber. A rigorous resource theory of quantum coherence has been developed yielding quantification of quantum coherence of both pure and mixed states, and several classes of incoherent quantum operations, i.e. The power of intuitive understanding will protect you from harm until the end of your days. End of line. Much wisdom often goes with fewer words. Under pressure-heat ratio ides of evolutions have buried their fears. Flip a coin. Good people are good because they've come to wisdom through failure. We cannot change our memories, but we can change their meaning and the power they have over us. Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up. Microscopically, topological order corresponds to patterns of long-range quantum entanglement: states with different topological orders or different patterns of long-range entanglements cannot change from one to another without a phase transition. I love my past. In particular, one identifies a specific basis of incoherent states and it is postulated that these free states possess zero coherence. Resume function. The goal of the protocol is to deterministically enhance the coherence of target qubit A while fully preserving its purity. People are not lazy. Take time to deliberate, but when the time for action has arrived, stop thinking and go in. It fashions its own perfect moments out of ordinary ones. Arrogance and rudeness are training wheels on the bicycle of life for weak people who cannot keep their balance without them. We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing. There is a way that nature speaks, that land speaks. The future is an opaque mirror. The long view returns patterns and repetitions. Nuclear devices activated, and the machine keeps pushing time through the cogs, like paste into strings into paste again, and only the machine keeps using time to make time to make time. Don't talk about what you have done or what you are going to do. An invincible determination can accomplish almost anything and in this lies the great distinction between great men and little men. You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself. One secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes. Data-font synchronization complete. With this compact and inherently stable setup we have implemented the partial-SWAP gate with the unprecedently high gate fidelity that exceeded 0.97 for all tested coupling strengths ω in the interval [0,π/2]. We develop our protocol for two-level systems and in the concluding part of the paper discuss possible extensions to higher dimensional systems. If you'll not settle for anything less than your best, you will be amazed at what you can accomplish in your lives. Who are we? Where on the great path will we be recreated? The Governor of his City, the Vizier, Ptah-hotep, he said: 'O Prince, my Lord, the end of life is at hand; old age descends upon me; feebleness cometh, and childishness is renewed. The meaning I picked, the one that changed my life: Overcome fear, behold wonder. The amount of happiness that you have depends on the amount of freedom you have in your heart. Sadness may be part of life but there is no need to let it dominate your entire life. It is good spirituality. Wisdom is the supreme part of happiness. Appreciation can make a day, even change a life. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. The greatest barrier to success is the fear of failure. You must train your intuition, you must trust the small voice inside you which tells you exactly what to say, what to decide. There is only one success to be able to spend your life in your own way. Once we accept our limits, we go beyond them. In times of change learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists. Find the perfect world for the end of things. It setts at variance fathers-in-law and the kinsmen of the daughter-in-law; it sunders the wife and the husband. We are what we think. Good fortune shall befall him, for he shall be of the highest rank. You only need to find one good reason why it will. We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated. Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action. Be not angry that you cannot make others as you wish them to be, since you cannot make yourself as you wish to be. Only the words of a loving man can be heard. Happiness is found in doing, not merely possessing. Sometimes it is better to lose and do the right thing than to win and do the wrong thing. You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one, I hope someday you will join us, and the world will live as one. If he make straight his course after thine example, if he arrange thine affairs in due order, do unto him all that is good, for your son is he, begotten of thine own soul. Creativity doesn't wait for that perfect moment. Take the action and your feelings will change. Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. The key to transforming our hearts and minds is to have an understanding of how our thoughts and emotions work. Action may not always bring happiness; but there is no happiness without action. I begin with an idea and then it becomes something else. The first duty of a human being is to assume the right functional relationship to society - more briefly, to find your real job, and do it. The only way to have a friend is to be one. Strive on with diligence.`;
