    title: `Mental Models`,
    description: `Mental models are frameworks for thinking. They simplify complex situations so you can reason through them easily. They help you make good, long-term decisions without needing to know everything about a situation.`,
    insight: `Mental models are what people mean when they use the word "wisdom."<br><br>When we think of someone as "wise," they're simply using models to generate insights-whether they realize they're using models or not. Specifically, a wise person is doing one of two things:<ol><li>Using a model to explain how a system works in a way you hadn't realized.</li><li>Using a model to identify the best decision to make amid all the noise.</li></ol>Every wise thing you've ever heard falls into one of those two categories.<br><br>Wisdom is therefore the arbitrage one person has over another due to their greater use of mental models and the data they have powering them.`

When I have thus got them altogether in one view, I endeavor to estimate their respective weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out. If I judge some two reasons con equal to some three reasons pro, I strike out five; and thus proceeding, I find where the balance lies; and if after a day or two of further consideration, nothing new that is of importance occurs on either side, I come to a determination accordingly." - Benjamin Franklin`

    title: `Inversion`,
    description: `Inversion is a powerful tool to improve your thinking because it helps you identify and remove obstacles to success. The root of inversion is "invert," which means to upend or turn upside down. As a thinking tool it means approaching a situation from the opposite end of the natural starting point. Most of us tend to think one way about a problem: forward. Inversion allows us to flip the problem around and think backward. Sometimes it's good to start at the beginning, but it can be more useful to start at the end.`,

For example, a man inside an airplane does not feel like he is experiencing movement, but an outside observer can see that movement is occurring. This form of relativity tends to affect social systems in a similar way.`,
    insight: `A few centuries ago, when Galileo (1564-1642) was trying to make a couple of points about how our world really works, one of the arguments that frequently came up in response to his 'the earth orbits the sun' theory was "if the earth is moving through space, how come I don't notice?"

Tendency to Stereotype: The tendency to broadly generalize and categorize rather than look for specific nuance. Like availability, this is generally a necessary trait for energy-saving in the brain.<br><br>c. Failure to See False Conjunctions:Most famously demonstrated by the Linda Test, the same two psychologists showed that students chose more vividly described individuals as more likely to fit into a predefined category than individuals with broader, more inclusive, but less vivid descriptions, even if the vivid example was a mere subset of the more inclusive set. These specific examples are seen as more representative of the category than those with the broader but vaguer descriptions, in violation of logic and probability.`

    title: `Social Proof (Safety in Numbers)`,
    description: `Human beings are one of many social species, along with bees, ants, and chimps, among many more. We have a DNA-level instinct to seek safety in numbers and will look for social guidance of our behavior. This instinct creates a cohesive sense of cooperation and culture which would not otherwise be possible but also leads us to do foolish things if our group is doing them as well.`,

{
    title: `Narrative Instinct`,
    description: `Human beings have been appropriately called "the storytelling animal" because of our instinct to construct and seek meaning in narrative. It's likely that long before we developed the ability to write or to create objects, we were telling stories and thinking in stories. Nearly all social organizations, from religious institutions to corporations to nation-states, run on constructions of the narrative instinct.`,

{
    title: `Curiosity Instinct`,
    description: `We like to call other species curious, but we are the most curious of all, an instinct which led us out of the savanna and led us to learn a great deal about the world around us, using that information to create the world in our collective minds. The curiosity instinct leads to unique human behavior and forms of organization like the scientific enterprise. Even before there were direct incentives to innovate, humans innovated out of curiosity.`,

    title: `Language Instinct`,
    description: `The psychologist Steven Pinker calls our DNA-level instinct to learn grammatically constructed language the Language Instinct. The idea that grammatical language is not a simple cultural artifact was first popularized by the linguist Noam Chomsky. As we saw with the narrative instinct, we use these instincts to create shared stories, as well as to gossip, solve problems, and fight, among other things. Grammatically ordered language theoretically carries infinite varying meaning.`,

    title: `First-Conclusion Bias`,
    description: `As Charlie Munger famously pointed out, the mind works a bit like a sperm and egg: the first idea gets in and then the mind shuts. Like many other tendencies, this is probably an energy-saving device. Our tendency to settle on first conclusions leads us to accept many erroneous results and cease asking questions; it can be countered with some simple and useful mental routines.`,

{
    title: `Tendency to Overgeneralize from Small Samples`,
    description: `It's important for human beings to generalize; we need not see every instance to understand the general rule, and this works to our advantage. With generalizing, however, comes a subset of errors when we forget about the Law of Large Numbers and act as if it does not exist. We take a small number of instances and create a general category, even if we have no statistically sound basis for the conclusion.`,

    title: `Relative Satisfaction/Misery Tendencies`,
    description: `The envy tendency is probably the most obvious manifestation of the relative satisfaction tendency, but nearly all studies of human happiness show that it is related to the state of the person relative to either their past or their peers, not absolute. These relative tendencies cause us great misery or happiness in a very wide variety of objectively different situations and make us poor predictors of our own behavior and feelings.`,

{
    title: `Commitment & Consistency Bias`,
    description: `As psychologists have frequently and famously demonstrated, humans are subject to a bias towards keeping their prior commitments and staying consistent with our prior selves when possible. This trait is necessary for social cohesion: people who often change their conclusions and habits are often distrusted. Yet our bias towards staying consistent can become, as one wag put it, a "hobgoblin of foolish minds" - when it is combined with the first-conclusion bias, we end up landing on poor answers and standing pat in the face of great evidence.`,
    insight: ``

{
    title: `Hindsight Bias`,
    description: `Once we know the outcome, it's nearly impossible to turn back the clock mentally. Our narrative instinct leads us to reason that we knew it all along (whatever "it" is), when in fact we are often simply reasoning post-hoc with information not available to us before the event. The hindsight bias explains why it's wise to keep a journal of important decisions for an unaltered record and to re-examine our beliefs when we convince ourselves that we knew it all along.`,

    title: `Sensitivity to Fairness`,
    description: `Justice runs deep in our veins. In another illustration of our relative sense of well-being, we are careful arbiters of what is fair. Violations of fairness can be considered grounds for reciprocal action, or at least distrust. Yet fairness itself seems to be a moving target. What is seen as fair and just in one time and place may not be in another. Consider that slavery has been seen as perfectly natural and perfectly unnatural in alternating phases of human existence.`,

    title: `Tendency to Overestimate Consistency of Behavior`,
    description: `We tend to over-ascribe the behavior of others to their innate traits rather than to situational factors, leading us to overestimate how consistent that behavior will be in the future. In such a situation, predicting behavior seems not very difficult. Of course, in practice this assumption is consistently demonstrated to be wrong, and we are consequently surprised when others do not act in accordance with the "innate" traits we've endowed them with.`,

    title: `Influence of Stress (Including Breaking Points)`,
    description: `Stress causes both mental and physiological responses and tends to amplify the other biases. Almost all human mental biases become worse in the face of stress as the body goes into a fight-or-flight response, relying purely on instinct without the emergency brake of Daniel Kahneman's "System 2" type of reasoning. Stress causes hasty decisions, immediacy, and a fallback to habit, thus giving rise to the elite soldiers' motto: "In the thick of battle, you will not rise to the level of your expectations, but fall to the level of your training."`,

    description: `A major problem with historiography - our interpretation of the past - is that history is famously written by the victors. We do not see what Nassim Taleb calls the "silent grave" - the lottery ticket holders who did not win. Thus, we over-attribute success to things done by the successful agent rather than to randomness or luck, and we often learn false lessons by exclusively studying victors without seeing all of the accompanying losers who acted in the same way but were not lucky enough to succeed.`,

    title: `Falsification / Confirmation Bias`,
    description: `What a man wishes, he also believes. Similarly, what we believe is what we choose to see. This is commonly referred to as the confirmation bias. It is a deeply ingrained mental habit, both energy-conserving and comfortable, to look for confirmations of long-held wisdom rather than violations. Yet the scientific process - including hypothesis generation, blind testing when needed, and objective statistical rigor - is designed to root out precisely the opposite, which is why it works so well when followed.`,
    insight: `The modern scientific enterprise operates under the principle of falsification: A method is termed scientific if it can be stated in such a way that a certain defined result would cause it to be proved false. Pseudo-knowledge and pseudo-science operate and propagate by being unfalsifiable - as with astrology, we are unable to prove them either correct or incorrect because the conditions under which they would be shown false are never stated.`

    description: `The endowment effect refers to an emotional bias that causes individuals to value an owned object higher, often irrationally, than its market value. Also known as divestiture aversion and related to the mere ownership effect in social psychology.`,
    insight: `The endowment effect describes a circumstance in which an individual places a higher value on an object that they already own than the value they would place on that same object if they did not own it.<br><br>Endowment effect can be clearly seen with items that have an emotional or symbolic significance to the individual.<br><br>Research has identified "ownership" and "loss aversion" as the two main psychological reasons causing the endowment effect.`

    title: `Jealousy Tendency`,
    description: `There are two types of envy. The productive type is "inferiority," or the desire to raise yourself up to another person's level. Do you want to become as successful as your team's marketing director? You're motivated by this kind of envy.<br><br>The unproductive type is malicious envy, or the desire to take something valuable away from someone else -- not for your own means, but so they don't have it.`,
    insight: `These motivators are worth remembering when, for example, you're creating content for your audience. Your audience might be personally invested in a particular goal because they want to do as well or better than another person in their life or industry. Identifying your audiences' desires will help you craft content that seeks to solve their personal goals.`

{
    title: `Anchoring Bias`,
    description: `Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias that causes us to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we are given about a topic. When we are setting plans or making estimates about something, we interpret newer information from the reference point of our anchor, instead of seeing it objectively. This can skew our judgment, and prevent us from updating our plans or predictions as much as we should.`,
    insight: `When we become anchored to a specific figure or plan of action, we end up filtering all new information through the framework we initially drew up in our head, distorting our perception. This makes us reluctant to make significant changes to our plans, even if the situation calls for it.`
},
{
    title: `Action Bias`,
    description: `Why do we prefer doing something to doing nothing? The action bias describes our tendency to favor action over inaction, often to our benefit. However, there are times when we feel compelled to act, even if there's no evidence that it will lead to a better outcome than doing nothing would. Our tendency to respond with action as a default, automatic reaction, even without solid rationale to support it, has been termed the action bias.`,
    insight: `Prioritizing action over inaction, without sufficient reasoning to support it, can lead to mishandling of a situation. It's an automatic response, based upon impulse instead of logic. Since it's a decision made without taking all possible information into consideration, the action bias can cause us to go down a less effective route, which can compromise the outcome of the situation.`

{
    title: `The Affect Heuristic`,
    description: `Why do we rely on our current emotions when making quick decisions? The affect heuristic describes how we often rely on our emotions, rather than concrete information, when making decisions. This allows us to reach a conclusion quickly and easily, but can also distort our thinking and lead us to make suboptimal choices.`,
    insight: `The affect heuristic can influence decisions in essentially any domain, and it has been demonstrated that we tend to rely on this heuristic more in situations where there is significant time pressure1. This means that if we are ever given an important decision to make quickly, we may resort to this heuristic, which has the potential to lead us to choose poorly.<br><br>Furthermore, reliance on the affect heuristic can limit us. We may be unwilling to put ourselves out there because of some gut feeling that we won't succeed. This could prevent us from stepping out of our comfort zone at times when doing so could benefit us.`
},
{
    title: `The Ambiguity Effect`,
    description: `Why we prefer options that are known to us? The ambiguity effect is a cognitive bias that describes how we tend to avoid options that we consider to be ambiguous or to be missing information. We dislike uncertainty and are therefore more inclined to select an option for which the probability of achieving a certain favorable outcome is known.`,
    insight: `The ambiguity effect can prevent us from giving two viable options equal consideration. As a result, our decision making is affected. We may automatically decide against something based solely on the fact that we feel that putting our trust in the unknown is too risky. Engaging in this cognitive bias limits us, as it prevents us from reaping the long-term benefits of riskier decisions.`
},
{
    title: `Attentional Bias`,
    description: `Why do we focus more on some things than others? The attentional bias describes our tendency to focus on certain elements while ignoring others. Research has shown that many different factors can bias our attention, from external events and stimuli (such as a perceived threat to our safety) to internal states (such as hunger or sadness).`,
    insight: `Our attention is a finite resource: there are limits to how much we can attend to at any given time. In order to make rational decisions, ideally, we would want to consider all of our options and examine them each in turn. When attentional bias shows up, however, we end up directing a much larger share of our focus toward a single option or stimulus, and this comes at the expense of others. It can also make it more difficult for us to let go of distracting or unhelpful thoughts, causing us instead to fixate on (and overthink) certain things.`
},
{
    title: `The Availability Heuristic`,
    description: `Why do we tend to think that things that happened recently are more likely to happen again? The availability heuristic describes our tendency to use information that comes to mind quickly and easily when making decisions about the future.`,
    insight: `The availability heuristic can lead to bad decision-making because memories that are easily recalled are frequently insufficient for figuring out how likely things are to happen again in the future. Ultimately, this leaves the decision-maker with low-quality information to form the basis of their decision.`
},
{
    title: `The Barnum effect`,
    description: `Why do we believe our horoscopes? The Barnum effect, also commonly referred to as the Forer Effect, describes when individuals believe that generic information, which could apply to anyone, applies specifically to themselves.`,
    insight: `Our inability to distinguish between general and personalized feedback, products, or content can lead to poor decision-making if we are left unaware of the Barnum effect. This bias takes advantage of our gullibility and well-meaning nature, which can be impactful if it involves making real-life choices that could profoundly affect our future. Individuals who make decisions influenced by this effect are unable to logically analyze their decisions and their possible outcomes, in order to make appropriate choices.`
},
{
    title: `Bikeshedding`,
    description: `Why do we focus on trivial things? Bikeshedding, also known as Parkinson's law of triviality, describes our tendency to devote a disproportionate amount of our time to menial and trivial matters while leaving important matters unattended.`,
    insight: `Bikeshedding can have negative consequences on personal productivity because it causes us to manage time inefficiently. Every day, we have various tasks that we have to complete and bikeshedding causes us to disproportionately allocate time to these tasks. We end up spending too long on trivial tasks and leave ourselves no time to complete the more complex tasks, which tend to be more important in the grand scheme of things. Bikeshedding causes us to be short-sighted with our time allocation, going with the easiest task first because we think it will take less time to complete.<br><br>For example, if our to-do list for the day includes going to the grocery store, folding the laundry, and submitting our tax forms, we may spend more time getting groceries and folding laundry because these are easy, menial tasks. By the time we get around to submitting the tax forms, we barely have enough time left. As a result of bikeshedding, we have put off the most important task and wasted our time on things that are easy to check off our to-do list.`
},
{
    title: `Bounded Rationality`,
    description: `Why are we satisfied by "good enough"? Bounded rationality is a human decision-making process in which we attempt to satisfice, rather than optimize. In other words, we seek a decision that will be good enough, rather than the best possible decision.`,
    insight: `According to the decision-making process of bounded rationality, we are not inclined to find out all the necessary information that would be required to make a rational decision, because of cognitive and temporal limitations. This causes us to make choices that are satisfactory rather than optimal. <br><br>Our choices are still rational, considering the information that is realistically available to us, but may not be rational in lieu of all the possible information and resources. While it is difficult to behave according to perfect economic rationality, which is to maximize benefits while diminishing costs, making decisions based on bounded rationality can cause us to be inconsistent with our objectives.`
},
{
    title: `The Bundling Bias`,
    description: `Why do we value items purchased in a bundle less than those purchased individually? The bundling bias describes our tendency not to use up all the experiences that are bought as a group, which means that we don't get the full value of a bundle compared to an individual purchase.`,
    insight: `Although the bundling bias is able to somewhat negate the effects of the sunk-cost fallacy, it is not always in our best interest. While it may allow us to make decisions based on how we feel in the moment instead of based on past costs that we won't recover, it also makes us unlikely to obtain the full value of a bundled purchase, which means that we are wasting our money. The price for a bundled package often seems attractive because it is a good deal, all else being equal. However, it is only cheaper if we actually use each of the items in the package. If we only use up a few items in a bundle, we may actually be spending more per item than we would if we had bought the items individually. The bundling bias can make us susceptible to spending more money than is necessary and not getting the full value of a bundle. This demonstrates that we are not fully rational with our economic decisions and that companies can take advantage of our biases to make us spend more money.`

{
    title: `The Cashless Effect`,
    description: `Why does paying without physical cash increase the likelihood that we purchase something? The cashless effect describes our tendency to be more willing to pay when there is no physical money involved in a transaction. It means that we are more likely to purchase something on a credit card than if we have to pay for it with cash.`,
    insight: `The cashless effect is dangerous because it can lead to overspending. We make large purchases on our credit card at ease, because we find it harder to understand the value of money when it isn't tangible. We often forget that a credit card is literally a line of credit, that we later have to repay. The cashless effect, because we end up spending more money than we actually have, can quickly cause us to fall into debt. Apart from the financial downfalls of debt, research has also shown that individuals who have debt are twice as likely to suffer from depression and anxiety disorders.`

{
    title: `Category Size Bias`,
    description: `Why do we think we're more likely to win at the big casino versus the small one? Category size bias describes our tendency to believe outcomes are more likely to occur if they are part of a large category rather than part of a small category, even if each outcome is equally likely. While the bias is based on experimental studies that have been successfully replicated, the interpretation of the evidence remains mixed.`,
    insight: `Probability judgments are erroneously impacted by category size, so individuals are prone to misjudge the likelihood of a number of events. Since virtually everything belongs to some category, the ramifications of category size bias loom large.<br><br>Reviewing the logic and causal reasoning of an assumption can mitigate the category size bias. Instead of leaning heavily on intuitive probabilities, acknowledge that such intuitions may be fallible and consider whether we may be inappropriately giving weight to category size in probability judgments.`

{
    title: `Choice Overload`,
    description: `Choice overload, also known as overchoice, choice paralysis, or the paradox of choice, describes how people get overwhelmed when they are presented with a large number of options to choose from. While we tend to assume that more choice is a good thing, in many cases, research has shown that we have a harder time choosing from a larger array of options.`,
    insight: `Choice overload can cause us to delay making decisions-even important ones-because considering the many options available to us is so taxing on our cognitive systems. Having more options also lead to increased decreased satisfaction and lower confidence in our choice, as well as a higher chance that we will regret our decision.<br><br>How to avoid it: Set aside some dedicated browsing time, treat your choices as nonreversible, and try keeping a gratitude journal.`
},
{
    title: `Cognitive Dissonance`,
    description: `Why is it so hard to change someone's beliefs? Cognitive dissonance describes when we avoid having conflicting beliefs and attitudes because it makes us feel uncomfortable. The clash is usually dealt with by rejecting, debunking, or avoiding new information.`,
    insight: `Rejecting, rationalizing, or avoiding information that conflicts with our beliefs can lead us to make poor decisions. This is because the information is not rejected because it is false but because it makes us uncomfortable. Information that is both true and useful can often have this effect. Decisions made in the absence of true and useful information can have harmful consequences. Smoking, for example, has been shown to cause cancer and contribute to various other chronic health conditions. Smokers often rationalize their detrimental decision to continue smoking by either denying evidence that supports its health risks or by considering themselves to be the lucky exception.`

{
    title: `The Disposition Effect`,
    description: `Why do we tend to hold on to losing investments? The disposition effect refers to our tendency to prematurely sell assets that have made financial gains, while holding on to assets that are losing money. We are driven to sell our winning investments in order to ensure a profit, but are averse to selling losing investments in hopes of turning them into gains.`,
    insight: `Investment novices and professionals alike are privy to the disposition effect. As much as we like to feel logical and rational, we make many decisions driven by fear, pride,  and misconceptions. At the most basic level, we can all probably agree that it feels good to win and it feels bad to lose. So if we are given the chance between winning and losing, our response seems obvious and intuitive.<br><br>However, smart decision-making and good financial performance must be grounded in a comprehensive point of view, rather than an outlook of one-off wins and losses. A keen investor would cut their losing assets over selling assets that will likely continue "winning." By succumbing to the disposition effect, we are incurring more losses and fewer gains in the long-term.`

{
    title: `The Dunning-Kruger effect`,
    description: `Why can we not perceive our own abilities? The Dunning-Kruger effect occurs when a person's lack of knowledge and skills in a certain area cause them to overestimate their own competence. By contrast, this effect also causes those who excel in a given area to think the task is simple for everyone, and underestimate their relative abilities as well.`,
    insight: `As a result of the Dunning-Kruger effect, you may not know what you're good at, because you assume that what comes easily to you also comes easily to everyone else. You are therefore robbed of the ability to spot your own specialties and talents.<br><br>Moreover, when you excel at what is challenging to you, you might accidentally fall prey to the belief that that thing is where your talents lie. In reality, you may just be a below-average performer finally approaching average levels.Thinking you are better than you are at something can cause you to miss out on opportunities to learn from others, who truly are more skilled or more knowledgeable. Furthermore, thinking you are average at something when you really have great skill can cause you to miss opportunities to teach and spread knowledge to others.`
